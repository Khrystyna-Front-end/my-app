This hands-on book shows you how to use this popular JavaScript platform to create simple server applications, communicate with the client, build dynamic pages, work with data, and tackle other tasks. Although Node has a complete library of developer-contributed modules to automate server-side development, this book will show you how to program with Node on your own, so you truly understand the platform. Discover firsthand how well Node works as a web server, and how easy it is to learn and use.\",\r\n  },\r\n];\r\n"],"mappings":"AAAA,OAAO,MAAMA,KAAK,GAAG,CACnB;EACEC,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,MAAM,EAAE,gBAAgB;EACxBC,KAAK,EAAE,KAAK;EACZC,KAAK,EAAE,8BAA8B;EACrCC,KAAK,EACH,uHAAuH;EACzHC,KAAK,EAAE,+CAA+C;EACtDC,IAAI,EAAE,mVAAmV;EACzVC,gBAAgB,EACd,sIAAsI;EACxIC,WAAW,EACT;AACJ,CAAC,EACD;EACER,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,MAAM,EAAE,gBAAgB;EACxBC,KAAK,EAAE,KAAK;EACZC,KAAK,EAAE,8BAA8B;EACrCC,KAAK,EAAE,EAAE;EACTC,KAAK,EAAE,0BAA0B;EACjCC,IAAI,EAAE,+JAA+J;EACrKC,gBAAgB,EACd,0VAA0V;EAC5VC,WAAW,EACT;AACJ,CAAC,EACD;EACER,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,MAAM,EAAE,eAAe;EACvBC,KAAK,EAAE,IAAI;EACXC,KAAK,EAAE,8BAA8B;EACrCC,KAAK,EACH,6GAA6G;EAC/GC,KAAK,EAAE,uBAAuB;EAC9BC,IAAI,EAAE,2FAA2F;EACjGC,gBAAgB,EACd,wMAAwM;EAC1MC,WAAW,EACT;AACJ,CAAC,EACD;EACER,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,MAAM,EAAE,0BAA0B;EAClCC,KAAK,EAAE,KAAK;EACZC,KAAK,EACH,4GAA4G;EAC9GC,KAAK,EACH,kHAAkH;EACpHC,KAAK,EAAE,6BAA6B;EACpCC,IAAI,EAAE,gEAAgE;EACtEC,gBAAgB,EACd,oFAAoF;EACtFC,WAAW,EACT;AACJ,CAAC,EACD;EACER,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,MAAM,EAAE,iBAAiB;EACzBC,KAAK,EAAE,KAAK;EACZC,KAAK,EAAE,8BAA8B;EACrCC,KAAK,EACH,wHAAwH;EAC1HC,KAAK,EAAE,kCAAkC;EACzCC,IAAI,EAAE,6CAA6C;EACnDC,gBAAgB,EACd,sHAAsH;EACxHC,WAAW,EACT;AACJ,CAAC,EACD;EACER,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,MAAM,EAAE,0BAA0B;EAClCC,KAAK,EAAE,KAAK;EACZC,KAAK,EACH,wEAAwE;EAC1EC,KAAK,EACH,4HAA4H;EAC9HC,KAAK,EAAE,wCAAwC;EAC/CC,IAAI,EAAE,wLAAwL;EAC9LC,gBAAgB,EACd,sKAAsK;EACxKC,WAAW,EACT;AACJ,CAAC,EACD;EACER,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,MAAM,EAAE,iBAAiB;EACzBC,KAAK,EAAE,KAAK;EACZC,KAAK,EAAE,yBAAyB;EAChCC,KAAK,EACH,wHAAwH;EAC1HC,KAAK,EAAE,kCAAkC;EACzCC,IAAI,EAAE,mCAAmC;EACzCC,gBAAgB,EACd,0IAA0I;EAC5IC,WAAW,EACT;AACJ,CAAC,EACD;EACER,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,MAAM,EAAE,gBAAgB;EACxBC,KAAK,EAAE,KAAK;EACZC,KAAK,EACH,wEAAwE;EAC1EC,KAAK,EACH,8GAA8G;EAChHC,KAAK,EAAE,yBAAyB;EAChCC,IAAI,EAAE,iCAAiC;EACvCC,gBAAgB,EACd,uKAAuK;EACzKC,WAAW,EACT;AACJ,CAAC,EACD;EACER,EAAE,EAAE,CAAC;EACLC,MAAM,EAAE,6CAA6C;EACrDC,KAAK,EAAE,KAAK;EACZC,KAAK,EAAE,qCAAqC;EAC5CC,KAAK,EACH,wGAAwG;EAC1GC,KAAK,EAAE,kBAAkB;EACzBC,IAAI,EAAE,mDAAmD;EACzDC,gBAAgB,EACd,oJAAoJ;EACtJC,WAAW,EACT;AACJ,CAAC,EACD;EACER,EAAE,EAAE,EAAE;EACNC,MAAM,EAAE,0BAA0B;EAClCC,KAAK,EAAE,IAAI;EACXC,KAAK,EAAE,8BAA8B;EACrCC,KAAK,EACH,6HAA6H;EAC/HC,KAAK,EAAE,uCAAuC;EAC9CC,IAAI,EAAE,uEAAuE;EAC7EC,gBAAgB,EACd,yKAAyK;EAC3KC,WAAW,EACT;AACJ,CAAC,EACD;EACER,EAAE,EAAE,EAAE;EACNC,MAAM,EAAE,WAAW;EACnBC,KAAK,EAAE,KAAK;EACZC,KAAK,EAAE,0BAA0B;EACjCC,KAAK,EAAE,EAAE;EACTC,KAAK,EAAE,mDAAmD;EAC1DC,IAAI,EAAE,0CAA0C;EAChDC,gBAAgB,EACd,yIAAyI;EAC3IC,WAAW,EACT;AACJ,CAAC,EACD;EACER,EAAE,EAAE,EAAE;EACNC,MAAM,EAAE,iBAAiB;EACzBC,KAAK,EAAE,KAAK;EACZC,KAAK,EACH,sEAAsE;EACxEC,KAAK,EACH,iGAAiG;EACnGC,KAAK,EAAE,WAAW;EAClBC,IAAI,EAAE,gDAAgD;EACtDC,gBAAgB,EACd,sJAAsJ;EACxJC,WAAW,EACT;AACJ,CAAC,EACD;EACER,EAAE,EAAE,EAAE;EACNC,MAAM,EAAE,mBAAmB;EAC3BC,KAAK,EAAE,KAAK;EACZC,KAAK,EACH,oJAAoJ;EACtJC,KAAK,EACH,kHAAkH;EACpHC,KAAK,EAAE,4BAA4B;EACnCC,IAAI,EAAE,4CAA4C;EAClDC,gBAAgB,EACd,kKAAkK;EACpKC,WAAW,EACT;AACJ,CAAC,EACD;EACER,EAAE,EAAE,EAAE;EACNC,MAAM,EAAE,qCAAqC;EAC7CC,KAAK,EAAE,KAAK;EACZC,KAAK,EAAE,uDAAuD;EAC9DC,KAAK,EACH,4HAA4H;EAC9HC,KAAK,EAAE,uCAAuC;EAC9CC,IAAI,EAAE,yFAAyF;EAC/FC,gBAAgB,EACd,wHAAwH;EAC1HC,WAAW,EACT;AACJ,CAAC,EACD;EACER,EAAE,EAAE,EAAE;EACNC,MAAM,EAAE,kDAAkD;EAC1DC,KAAK,EAAE,KAAK;EACZC,KAAK,EAAE,iCAAiC;EACxCC,KAAK,EACH,gIAAgI;EAClIC,KAAK,EAAE,4CAA4C;EACnDC,IAAI,EAAE,SAAS;EACfC,gBAAgB,EACd,oFAAoF;EACtFC,WAAW,EACT;AACJ,CAAC,EACD;EACER,EAAE,EAAE,EAAE;EACNC,MAAM,EAAE,iBAAiB;EACzBC,KAAK,EAAE,IAAI;EACXC,KAAK,EAAE,eAAe;EACtBC,KAAK,EACH,oGAAoG;EACtGC,KAAK,EAAE,cAAc;EACrBC,IAAI,EAAE,8BAA8B;EACpCC,gBAAgB,EACd,mEAAmE;EACrEC,WAAW,EACT;AACJ,CAAC,EACD;EACER,EAAE,EAAE,EAAE;EACNC,MAAM,EAAE,iDAAiD;EACzDC,KAAK,EAAE,KAAK;EACZC,KAAK,EACH,qIAAqI;EACvIC,KAAK,EACH,qHAAqH;EACvHC,KAAK,EAAE,+BAA+B;EACtCC,IAAI,EAAE,4DAA4D;EAClEC,gBAAgB,EACd,0HAA0H;EAC5HC,WAAW,EACT;AACJ,CAAC,EACD;EACER,EAAE,EAAE,EAAE;EACNC,MAAM,EAAE,eAAe;EACvBC,KAAK,EAAE,KAAK;EACZC,KAAK,EAAE,gEAAgE;EACvEC,KAAK,EACH,sGAAsG;EACxGC,KAAK,EAAE,gBAAgB;EACvBC,IAAI,EAAE,2EAA2E;EACjFC,gBAAgB,EACd,yFAAyF;EAC3FC,WAAW,EACT;AACJ,CAAC,EACD;EACER,EAAE,EAAE,EAAE;EACNC,MAAM,EAAE,yBAAyB;EACjCC,KAAK,EAAE,IAAI;EACXC,KAAK,EAAE,iEAAiE;EACxEC,KAAK,EACH,qGAAqG;EACvGC,KAAK,EAAE,eAAe;EACtBC,IAAI,EAAE,+BAA+B;EACrCC,gBAAgB,EAAE,oDAAoD;EACtEC,WAAW,EACT;AACJ,CAAC,EACD;EACER,EAAE,EAAE,EAAE;EACNC,MAAM,EAAE,gBAAgB;EACxBC,KAAK,EAAE,KAAK;EACZC,KAAK,EACH,uFAAuF;EACzFC,KAAK,EACH,iHAAiH;EACnHC,KAAK,EAAE,4BAA4B;EACnCC,IAAI,EAAE,iGAAiG;EACvGC,gBAAgB,EACd,wKAAwK;EAC1KC,WAAW,EACT;AACJ,CAAC,EACD;EACER,EAAE,EAAE,EAAE;EACNC,MAAM,EAAE,cAAc;EACtBC,KAAK,EAAE,KAAK;EACZC,KAAK,EACH,gKAAgK;EAClKC,KAAK,EACH,qHAAqH;EACvHC,KAAK,EAAE,+BAA+B;EACtCC,IAAI,EAAE,+CAA+C;EACrDC,gBAAgB,EACd,gJAAgJ;EAClJC,WAAW,EACT;AACJ,CAAC,CACF","ignoreList":[]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
